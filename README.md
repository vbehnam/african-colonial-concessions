# Colonial Concessions Project

This is a sample of the work I did for economist Stelios Michalopoulos. We are trying to ascertain the long-run effects of colonial institutions on modern economic and social outcomes in Africa. 

Where I come in is I first find old, colonial-era maps. I superimpose these map onto a World Geographic Society 1984 World Coordinate System. Then I digitize notable areas of colonial influence, using arcGIS. Those colonial areas are put into a shapefile, with information about the concession and the map.
