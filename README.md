# Colonial Concessions Project

This is a sample of the work I did for economist Stelios Michalopoulos. We are trying to ascertain the long-run effects of colonial concessions on modern economic and social outcomes in Africa. Colonial concessions were tracts of land granted by the colonial powers to private companies.

Where I come in is I first find old, colonial-era maps. Using ArcGIS, I superimpose these maps onto the World Geographic Society 1984 World Coordinate System. Then I digitize notable areas of colonial concessions. Those colonial areas are put into a shapefile, with information about the concession and the map.

In each folder is a readme, a colonial-era map, and a shapefile zipfile mapping out all the colonial concessions of said map.

I do not own any of the colonial maps. They are the property of their respective owners, and are here purely for demonstrative and educational purposes.

The license file has more detail, but feel free to use the shapefiles, but please cite me. (and I would appreciate it further if you would notify me)
