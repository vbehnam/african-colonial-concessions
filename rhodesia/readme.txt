Notes:

Please note that for Sinoia Citrus Estate, there are multiple small red dots apparently signifying the position of the concession. (please refer to pg 6 of the CO 792-23 pdf)
 
In the shapefile, I used a large polygon to engulf all these dots, which has also included areas that are not concessions! 
So please note that this polygon shapefile is just for alerting the user to its presence, and it is not at all representative of the actual concession in the map.


Simoona Estate is also quite small, so there may be some slight precision issues there as well.

And, just to be sure, polygons with 0 acres do not have information about their size in the map.
