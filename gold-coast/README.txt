This map has both the Ivory Coast and Ghana. 

Hence, I've made three different shapefiles, one of the Ivory Coast and two of Ghana.

Ghana has two shapefiles because one contains all the polygons in Ghana, while the other contains the points in Ghana. We do not have a legend as of yet for the map. 
I think the polygons represent concessions, but I'm not sure what the points are (some seem to be mines or concessions)

Notice also that many of the concessions in the map are unnamed.


For Ghana:

We were not able to locate a legend for the map. Hence, we are not sure what the different borders kinds signify.

The Southeast/Southcenter portion of the map (Around Ahinta and Opinto) has so much overlap of concessions, which makes precision very difficult to achieve.

Unfortunately, many concessions overlap and the map did not make it clear which concession has what name. 
So please double check the map if the name is critical.
